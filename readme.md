A cool pixel art app for game developers and artists. 

## Planned Features

- **Pallete Management** - Manage your palletes across sprites to maintain a consistant pallete for your entire game, with built in Pallete analysis tools and automatic color correction.

- **Dithering Brushes** - Take advantage of dithering research normally reserved for gifs to make your pixel art amazing.

- **Smart Deformations** - Transform your sprites without worrying about losing fidelity, rotate, scale, and skew to your heart's content.

- **Animations** - build your animations with onion skinning, bones, or a mix of both! Load bone animations from blender and render them out as pixel art!

- **Command Pallete** - Similar to most text editors, you can type away commands to get things done faster.

- **Extensions** - Add more features with the extension api, make a custom brush script, generate some art procedurally, you name it! Our API features Type Definitions for your JavaScript or TypeScript code for autocomplete & code linting.
